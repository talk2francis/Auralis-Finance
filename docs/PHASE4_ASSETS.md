# Phase 4 Assets — Drafts While Live URL / Video Are Pending

Purpose: prepare the Phase 4 submission copy that does not require the final live deployment/video links yet.

Related docs: [Submission Checklist](./SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md), [Pitch](./PITCH.md), [Judge Guide](./JUDGE_GUIDE.md), [Video Script](./video-script.md), [Contracts](./CONTRACTS.md).

## Domain plan

Use **one canonical domain**:

- Primary: `https://auralisfinance.xyz`
- Optional alias: `https://www.auralisfinance.xyz` → redirect/canonicalize to apex
- Vercel URL: fallback/internal deployment URL only, not the brand link for submission

### Vercel DNS records

After the Vercel project is connected, add the domain in Vercel, then set DNS where `auralisfinance.xyz` is registered:

| Host | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `@` | `A` | `76.76.21.21` |
| `www` | `CNAME` | `cname.vercel-dns.com` |

Use `auralisfinance.xyz` everywhere in public copy once DNS is live. There is no need for a second purchased domain.

## Step 4.2 — X / Twitter thread draft

Status: copy-ready draft, **do not post until live URL + demo video links are filled**.

Replace placeholders before posting:

- `[LIVE_APP_URL]` → `https://auralisfinance.xyz`
- `[DEMO_VIDEO_URL]` → YouTube unlisted demo video
- `[SHORT_CLIP_URL]` → 30–60s short clip if posted separately

### Main thread — 10 posts

Auralis Finance is the AI risk and compliance layer for tokenized real-world assets on Mantle.

Most RWA apps show yield. Auralis answers the missing questions: what is the risk, may this wallet hold it, and can the decision be verified later?

#MantleAIHackathon @0xMantle

**2/10**
The hook: we rated Mantle RWAs in a public explorer — no wallet needed.

Open `[LIVE_APP_URL]/ratings` and check the asset ratings, risk scores, methodology version, and proof framing.

This is designed as infrastructure other Mantle apps can consume.

**3/10**
Auralis has 3 pillars:

1. Ratings — seven-dimension RWA risk scoring
2. Compliance — wallet eligibility and attestations
3. Guardrails — policy-safe AI portfolio decisions

AI explains. Deterministic code decides. Users sign. Mantle verifies.

**4/10**
Demo asset: USDY.

Auralis computes a deterministic rating across asset, issuer, liquidity, peg, oracle, contract, and concentration risk. The AI turns that vector into a plain-language rationale, but it never invents the score.

**5/10**
Ratings are verifiable.

`AuralisRatingRegistry` stores rating hashes on Mantle mainnet. The app can recompute the rating hash and verify it against the registry instead of asking users to trust a black-box AI answer.

**6/10**
Compliance is the differentiator.

A wallet scan checks jurisdiction, sanctions/risk flags, and asset-class rules. For Treasury-style RWAs like USDY, Auralis produces Eligible / Restricted / Denied verdicts with cited reasons.

**7/10**
Attestations are privacy-preserving.

The verdict and report hash go on-chain. Sensitive inputs stay off-chain. The user signs the attestation; Auralis never holds funds and never signs for the user.

**8/10**
The agent can simulate rebalances, but it cannot run away.

Policy checks cover exposure, protocol concentration, liquidity, confidence, slippage, cooldown, and human approval. If a proposal violates policy, it is blocked before execution.

## 5 follow-up posts for Community Voting

**Follow-up 1 — build-in-public**
Auralis is built around one core design rule: AI explains, deterministic code decides, users sign, Mantle verifies.

That keeps the UX intelligent without giving an AI agent custody or autonomous execution rights.

`[LIVE_APP_URL]`

**Follow-up 2 — ratings spotlight**
The public ratings explorer is the viral surface: Mantle RWA ratings with no wallet required.

Each rating includes grade, risk score, methodology version, and proof framing — built to be consumed by users, wallets, and DeFi apps.

`[LIVE_APP_URL]/ratings`

**Follow-up 3 — compliance spotlight**
Compliance should not be hidden behind PDFs.

Auralis turns wallet eligibility into a structured, explainable, and attestable workflow: scan → verdict → report hash → Mantle proof.

`[LIVE_APP_URL]/app/compliance`

**Follow-up 4 — methodology spotlight**
Auralis scores RWA risk across seven dimensions: asset, issuer, liquidity, peg, oracle, contract, and concentration.

The goal is not hype — it is repeatable risk methodology that makes tokenized assets easier to evaluate.

`[LIVE_APP_URL]/methodology`

**Follow-up 5 — business vision**
Auralis can become paid infrastructure for the Mantle RWA ecosystem:

- Intelligence API
- Treasury monitoring tier
- Compliance attestation fees

The product is revenue-first, not token-first.

### Project name

Auralis Finance

### One-line pitch

Auralis is the AI risk and compliance layer for tokenized real-world assets on Mantle.

### What type of real-world asset are you bringing on-chain?

Auralis works with the real-world assets already tokenized on Mantle — tokenized U.S. Treasury and credit instruments such as USDY and QCDT-style regulated yield products, tokenized equities such as xStocks, and institutional index assets such as MI4 — alongside yield-bearing crypto-RWA assets like mETH/cmETH and synthetic-dollar yield such as USDe/sUSDe.

What Auralis newly brings on-chain is the missing layer for these assets: machine-readable, verifiable risk ratings and compliance/eligibility attestations — the credit-rating and due-diligence data that real-world finance depends on, published permanently on Mantle.

### How does AI play a role?

AI is the reasoning and explanation layer in three places.

1. Rating: an AI service explains deterministic, auditable risk signals such as collateral proof freshness, issuer/counterparty exposure, liquidity depth, depeg deviation, oracle freshness, and smart-contract surface.
2. Compliance: the agent interprets asset-class restrictions and jurisdiction rules against a screened wallet profile, then produces an eligibility verdict with cited reasons.
3. Portfolio: the Auralis agent proposes risk- and compliance-constrained rebalances, explains the reasoning, and passes through deterministic policy checks before any execution.

AI never holds keys and never auto-executes. It advises; deterministic code enforces; the human signs.

### How is it realized on Mantle?

Auralis is deployed on Mantle Mainnet, chainId `5000`. Four contracts store permanent, explorer-verifiable records:

- `AuralisAgentRegistry` — agent identity and metadata
- `AuralisRatingRegistry` — asset rating hashes and verification
- `AuralisComplianceAttestor` — compliance verdict attestations
- `AuralisPolicyGuard` — policy configuration and guarded decision checks

Auralis reads Mantle RWA data, computes deterministic ratings and eligibility verdicts, and links proofs to Mantle Explorer. The on-chain registries are public so other Mantle apps can consume Auralis as infrastructure.

### Track + path

Track: AI × RWA

Path: Path B — [AI-Driven] RWA Application

Justification: Auralis does not tokenize a new asset. Instead, it solves the post-issuance trust layer for tokenized RWAs: risk ratings, compliance eligibility, policy-safe AI recommendations, and on-chain proofs. This matches Path B because the product has clear asset categories, defined users, and a complete AI-driven application experience.
